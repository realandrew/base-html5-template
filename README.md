**NOTE**: To clarify, the license conditions of providing license and copyright notices, disclosing source, stating changes, and licensing under the same license only applies to forked versions of this project. If you're just using the project as is (i.e. as a template for starting your HTML5 code) then you are not required to fulfill these conditions. If there is a better license that covers this situation, let me know and I will re-license the project.
